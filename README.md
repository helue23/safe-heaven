# safe-heaven
Safe Haven is a web development class project of an e-commerce store that would donate money to women in STEM foundations created by a fellow class mate and I. This project was created using html, css, and javascript. 

# Motivation
This project was inspired by the gender gap in STEM. My class mate and I wanted to shine a light on this issue through a high fildelity prototype of an online store geared toward women. This store, Safe Haven, will sell apparel, stationary, and jewelry relating to being a woman in STEM. It was planned that some of our revenue would be donated to organizations and scholarship funds that support women in stem.
