# safe-heaven
Safe Haven is a web development class project of an e-commerce store that would donate money to women in STEM foundations created by a fellow class mate and I. This project was created using html, css, and javascript. Both my class mate and I, worked on the different sections equally. 

# Motivation
This project was inspired by the gender gap in STEM. My class mate and I wanted to shine a light on this issue through a high fildelity prototype of an online store geared toward women. This store, Safe Haven, will sell apparel, stationary, and jewelry relating to being a woman in STEM. It was planned that some of our revenue would be donated to organizations and scholarship funds that support women in stem. 

# Application
Happy Haven allows users to view apparel, stationary, and jewelery, and add it to their cart. As this is not a fully fleshed out e-commerce shop, there's no way to actually purchase. The cart feature was simply a way to showcase the use of Javascript in this project. 

There's also a 'donate' feature' which allows users to "donate" money that will go to a women in STEM supporting organization. This feature was created using an html form. However, as I mentioned previously, the data garnered does not get sent anywhere. 

# Future work
In upcoming future, I will be making changes and edits to the styling and the functionality of this web application to further showcase my abilities.
